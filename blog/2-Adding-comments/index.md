## About GitHub Discussions component

Check [Quickstart for GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart) to find out the depth and breath of this component. For the purpose of this RADC application we use a restricted set of Github Discussion component presented to the user via **`giscus`** component, open source software application created by Sage Abdullah in his blog [Introducing giscus](https://laymonage.com/posts/giscus) in this [section](https://laymonage.com/posts/giscus#github-discussions-).

Giscus widget and Github Discussions are still under active development, so this implementation created for RADC will likely have to change with time. See [giscus repository](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) for more information.
