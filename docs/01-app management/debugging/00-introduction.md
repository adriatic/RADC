# Introduction

This section on Redwood applications debugging is organized as a set of three chapters. All the information presented in this document extends the sections [Debugger information](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/project-configuration-dev-test-build#debugger-configuration) from the RedwoodJS tutorial application.

We are describing the concept of debugging RedwoodJS applications using two different tools (Chrome and VSCode debuggers), skipping several alternatives. We will also skip the use of Chrome in a distributed setup, meaning that we will consider only the case of debugging the front end of the RedwoodJS application. The next two cases, A and B briefly describe our intent 

## Case A: Using Chrome debugger
The simplest use case scenario is to start the target application from the Terminal (use the command `yarn rw dev`). This results with
