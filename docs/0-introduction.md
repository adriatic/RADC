### What is RADC

The intent of this project is to create a big cookbook (the title Redwood Applications Development Cookbook implies the "big" attribute as there ought be thousands ideas on helping new Redwood application developer get up to speed).

### How to get involved in this (RADC) project

The content of the cookbook (RADC) is expected to come from Redwood Application developers (excluding RW Core team), RW contributors or any other RW users willing to help augment Redwood Technical Documentation. Ideally people joining this project should also create the content, however just proposing the content is very welcome.

### Join the effort

Anyone is welcome to state interest in either adding to the List of articles or to declare interest in authoring any of the article from that same list (add to or take from the list 😃 )

To simplify the "add to the list" workflow, the initial list has three entries, already agreed upon on the last "office hour" last week. In addition to the entry "subject" please supply the list of tools the use of which should be documented and used in each cookbook entry.

Lastly, register your Name (1), Subject (2) as well as Tools (3) to be used, by sending email to radc@congral.com. Please make sure you use the template below:
