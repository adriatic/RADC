## Summary

This article is formatted as two interdependent documents:
- The first "Docker refresher" demonstrates how to install Docker locally, how to create a local instance of PostgreSQL server and how to Docker Compose (launch) a mini sample application that uses Docker based PostgreSQL server

- The second article defines the process to install and build the [RedwoodJS Tutorial App](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial), also known as the Redwood Blog application, locally. Note that the only difference between this article and [Install PostgreSQL with EDB Installer](https://rw-community.org/how%20to/Install%20PostgreSQL) article is the description of the installation and running the PostgreSQL server.
