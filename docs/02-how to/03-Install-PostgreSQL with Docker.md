## Summary

This article is formatted as two interdependent documents:
- The first "[Docker refresher](https://rw-community.org/how%20to/install-postgresql%20with%20docker/#docker-refresher)" demonstrates how to install Docker locally, how to create a local instance of PostgreSQL server and how to Docker Compose (launch) a mini sample application that uses Docker based PostgreSQL server

- The [second article](https://rw-community.org/how%20to/install-postgresql%20with%20docker/#install-and-build-redwood-blog-application) defines the process to install and build the [RedwoodJS Tutorial App](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial), also known as the Redwood Blog application, locally. Note that the only difference between this article and [Install PostgreSQL with EDB Installer](https://rw-community.org/how%20to/Install%20PostgreSQL) article is the description of the installation and running the PostgreSQL server.

## Docker Refresher

Please check the Docker's own [get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) tutorial and run the code presented in the following sections

- Build and run an image as a container.
- Share images using Docker Hub.
- Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database.
- Run applications using Docker Compose.

### Building a simple small application

The application used to demonstrate the above listed bullet points is a clone of https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
