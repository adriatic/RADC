### Summary

### Introduction

This article is written for all people who had problems following the Redwoods documentation on how to install the PostgreSQL [database](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/chapter4/deployment#the-database), using [Brew](https://brew.sh/).

If you installed PostgreSQL using Brew and have problems with this installation, start by uninstalling PostgreSQL using Brew. To do that, follow the process described in [Completely uninstalling a Homebrew installation of PostgresQL](https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2021-01-28-how-to-completely-uninstall-homebrew-postgres/#completely-uninstalling-a-homebrew-installation-of-postgres) (or any similar article).
The assumption now is that you do not have PostgresQL installed on your computer - however, if you are trying to remove a failed installation being dscribed here, use the two scripts `unistall-pgagent` and `uninstall-postgresql` which are in the macOS library (~/Library/PostgreSQL/14) as shown below

**Note:** using these uninstallers may not be trivially simple, since these are shell scripts - not applications, so you will have to work in it a bit :smile:.

### Download the installer

Fetch the installed from the [PostgreSQL EDB (enterprise db)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) website.
